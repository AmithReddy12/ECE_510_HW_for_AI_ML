# Neuromorphic Computing at Scale — Five Key Insights

## 1. The hardest challenge: scaling without compromise  
*Discuss compute–memory integration, sparsity, and local learning.*

## 2. Defining the “AlexNet” moment  
*Describe large-scale vision/LLM systems using neuromorphic hardware—transformers on Loihi 3.*

## 3. Interoperability via Event‑ONNX  
*Explain conversion pipeline and platform support.*

## 4. Benchmarking proposal  
*Detail metrics like energy-per-inference, latency, and neuron scaling.*

## 5. Emerging memories: memristor crossbars  
*Describe their role in event-driven, energy-efficient compute with local plasticity.*

**Conclusion:** A long-term roadmap for neuromorphic—from brain-scale compute to practical ecosystems.
